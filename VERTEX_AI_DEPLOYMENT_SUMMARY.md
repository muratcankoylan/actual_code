## 🎬 Demo Script for Judges

### Opening (30 seconds)
> "We've built ActualCode - a production-ready, multi-agent system deployed on Google Cloud's Vertex AI Agent Engine."

### Show Architecture (1 minute)
[Switch to Architecture view in UI]
> "Our system uses 7 specialized agents communicating via Google's A2A protocol. 
> 
> The Scanner Agent uses GitHub MCP to fetch repository data. Then 4 analysis agents run in parallel - Code, PR, Issue, and Dependency analyzers - sharing insights through 3 iterative loops using A2A protocol.
>
> The Problem Creator uses Gemini 2.5 Pro to generate the assessment, and the QA Validator ensures 85+ quality scores with an improvement loop."

### Show Deployment (1 minute)
[Open Cloud Console or show deployment config]
> "This isn't just running locally - it's deployed to Vertex AI Agent Engine.
>
> [Show config file]
> Here's our production configuration with all 7 agents, their models, temperatures, and A2A capabilities.
>
> The system supports enterprise features like CMEK encryption, VPC Service Controls, and HIPAA compliance."

### Live Demo (2 minutes)
[Run assessment generation]
> "Let me generate an assessment from a real repository...
>
> [Watch agents run in UI - show A2A Protocol tab]
> You can see the A2A messages flowing between agents in real-time. Each agent discovers capabilities, sends structured messages, and collaborates to build consensus.
>
> [Show results]
> In 2 minutes, our production system generated this validated assessment with a quality score of 92/100."

### Closing (30 seconds)
> "This is the first hackathon project implementing Google's A2A protocol on Vertex AI Agent Engine. It's not just innovative - it's production-ready, scalable, and demonstrates the future of multi-agent AI systems."
