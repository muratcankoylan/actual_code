## 📊 Demo Flow (3 Minutes)

### Act 1: The Problem (30 seconds)

**What to Show**:
- Pull up LeetCode/HackerRank
- Show a generic problem: "Two Sum", "Reverse Linked List"

**What to Say**:
> "Traditional coding platforms like LeetCode test candidates on abstract algorithms - two sum, reverse a linked list - problems that have nothing to do with the actual work they'll be doing. Hiring teams want to test candidates on skills relevant to their codebase, but creating repository-specific assessments is time-consuming and manual."

### Act 2: Our Solution (30 seconds)

**What to Show**:
- Open ActualCode web interface
- Enter a GitHub repository URL (e.g., https://github.com/vercel/next.js)
- Select difficulty: "Medium"
- Select problem type: "Feature"
- Click "Generate Assessment"

**What to Say**:
> "With ActualCode, you simply input any GitHub repository, select the difficulty level, and our AI-powered system generates a realistic, implementable coding challenge in under 3 minutes. Let me show you how it works."

**Visual**: Clean, professional UI with input form

### Act 3: Agent Magic 

**What to Show**:
- Real-time progress indicator showing:
  - 🔍 Step 1: Scanning GitHub Repository 
  - 🔄 Step 2-5: Multi-Agent Analysis Loop 1/3 
  - 🔄 Step 2-5: Multi-Agent Analysis Loop 2/3  
  - 🔄 Step 2-5: Multi-Agent Analysis Loop 3/3  
  - 📝 Step 6: Creating Coding Problem  
  - ✅ Step 7: Quality Validation   
  - ✨ Complete!    

**What to Say**:
> "Behind the scenes, 7 specialized AI agents are collaborating using Google's Agent2Agent protocol. 
>
> **Agent 1** uses GitHub MCP to scan the repository - analyzing the code, PRs, issues, and dependencies.
>
> **Agents 2-5** - our analysis team - run in parallel, each examining different aspects: code architecture, pull request patterns, issue trends, and tech stack. They communicate via A2A protocol, sharing insights across three iterative loops. In the first loop, they independently analyze. In the second loop, they cross-validate each other's findings. In the third loop, they build consensus on the best coding opportunities.
>
> **Agent 6** uses Gemini 2.5 Pro to create a detailed, realistic coding problem based on the synthesized analysis.
>
> **Agent 7**, our QA validator, scores the problem on feasibility, quality, technical accuracy, and educational value. If the score is below 85, it sends feedback back to Agent 6 for improvement.
>
> Watch the A2A messages flow between agents..."

>
> Notice how it's specific to Next.js - the repository we analyzed. It asks candidates to implement dynamic route caching, something actually relevant to working with this codebase.
>
> The problem includes clear requirements, acceptance criteria, starter code, and even helpful hints. Our QA agent validated it with a quality score of 92 out of 100.
>
> Compare this to 'Reverse a Linked List' - which problem better tests someone's ability to work with Next.js?"

**Visual**: 
- Split screen: LeetCode generic problem vs. ActualCode repository-specific problem

## 🎯 Q&A Preparation

### Expected Questions & Answers

**Q: How do you prevent hallucinations in generated problems?**  
A: We have a QA agent that validates on 4 dimensions with a minimum 85/100 score. Plus, an improvement loop that refines problems up to 2 times if they don't meet quality standards.

**Q: What if the repository is private?**  
A: Great question! Users can authenticate with GitHub OAuth, allowing our GitHub MCP integration to access private repositories with their permission.

**Q: How do you handle rate limiting from GitHub?**  
A: We implement exponential backoff and cache repository data for 24 hours in Cloud Storage.

**Q: Why A2A protocol? What's the benefit?**  
A: A2A enables true agent interoperability - agents can discover each other's capabilities and communicate seamlessly. It's Google's vision for the future of multi-agent systems, and we're demonstrating it works.

**Q: How long did this take to build?**  
A: The complete implementation took about 6 hours following our step-by-step guide, plus deployment time.

**Q: Can it handle non-JavaScript repositories?**  
A: Absolutely! It works with Python, Java, Go, and any language. The agents analyze patterns regardless of language.

**Q: How do you measure success?**  
A: Three metrics: (1) Generation time < 3 minutes, (2) Quality score > 85/100, (3) Agent success rate > 95%. We're hitting all three.
