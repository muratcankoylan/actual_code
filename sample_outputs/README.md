# Sample Outputs

This directory contains example outputs from ActualCode to demonstrate the system's capabilities.

## Files

### SAMPLE_AGENT_LOGS.txt
Complete agent execution logs showing:
- Repository data retrieval
- Multi-agent analysis process
- Problem generation
- QA validation
- Complete JSON inputs and outputs for all agents

This file demonstrates the transparency and traceability of the ActualCode system.

## Generating Your Own

When you run the CLI (`python cli_runner.py`), you'll get:

1. **`assessment_{timestamp}.json`** - Structured assessment output
2. **`DETAILED_RUN_{timestamp}.txt`** - Complete execution logs

These files are automatically generated in the project root directory.
