## 🔧 All Fixes Applied

### Issue #1: **3-Loop Adds Unnecessary Latency** ✅ FIXED
**Before:** 180 seconds (3 loops × 60s each)  
**After:** 60 seconds (single-pass)  
**Improvement:** **2 minutes faster!**

### Issue #2: **Output Not Related to Input Repository** ✅ FIXED
**Before:** Generic "To-Do app" or "Financial data" problems  
**After:** Problems STRICTLY about the input repository  
**How:** Enhanced Problem Creator prompt with MANDATORY repository context

### Issue #3: **Data Not Reaching Agents** ✅ FIXED
**Before:** 500 files fetched but agents saw "Files: 0"  
**After:** Agents now see all 500 files, 1 PR, 1 issue  
**How:** Fixed camelCase → snake_case (totalFiles → total_files)

### Issue #4: **QA Scoring Issues** ✅ FIXED
**Before:** Showed 71/100 then 0/100 at end  
**After:** Consistent scoring throughout  
**How:** Fixed data structure access in CLI display

### Issue #5: **No Comprehensive Logging** ✅ FIXED
**Before:** Only terminal output, hard to debug  
**After:** Auto-generates DETAILED_RUN_{timestamp}.txt  
**Contains:** All 500 files, complete analysis, full problem, QA details

### Issue #6: **GitHub Fetch Errors** ✅ FIXED
**Before:** TypeError: 'NoneType' object is not subscriptable  
**After:** Handles None values gracefully  
**How:** Changed `pr.get("body", "")[:500]` to `(pr.get("body") or "")[:500]`
