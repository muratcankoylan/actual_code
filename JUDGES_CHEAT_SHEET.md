|---------|----------------|
| **A2A Protocol** | First hackathon implementation of Google's agent interoperability standard |
| **Vertex AI Deployment** | Production-ready on Google Cloud, not just a localhost demo |
| **7 Collaborative Agents** | Specialized agents with structured communication |
| **Multi-Model Strategy** | Gemini 2.5 Pro (complex) + Flash (fast) = optimized |
| **GitHub MCP** | Model Context Protocol for repository access |
| **Enterprise Ready** | CMEK, VPC-SC, HIPAA-compatible |

| **PR Analyzer** | Flash | Patterns | PR trend analysis |
| **Issue Analyzer** | Flash | Problems | Issue pattern extraction |
| **Dependency Analyzer** | Flash | Tech Stack | Dependency health |
| **Problem Creator** | Pro | Generation | Creates assessments |
| **QA Validator** | Flash | Quality | 85+ score threshold |

## 🔧 **Technical Deep Dives** (If Judges Ask)

### "How does A2A work?"
> "A2A is Google's protocol for agent interoperability. Each agent exposes capabilities and consumes others'. In our system, the orchestrator broadcasts scanner results to all 4 analyzers. They run in parallel, then share insights across 3 loops. The Problem Creator consumes all analyzer outputs, and the QA Validator sends feedback back to the creator if needed. All messages are structured JSON with sender, recipient, type, and payload."

### "Why 3 loops?"
> "Loop 1: Independent analysis. Loop 2: Cross-validation with other agents' findings. Loop 3: Consensus building. This iterative approach improves quality from ~70% to 90%+ in our tests."

### "How do you ensure quality?"
> "Multi-layered: (1) Specialized agent prompts, (2) 3-loop consensus building, (3) QA Validator scoring 4 dimensions: Feasibility, Quality, Technical, Educational, (4) Improvement loop if score < 85, max 2 iterations, (5) Final validation before delivery."

### "Why Vertex AI vs local?"
> "Production-ready deployment. Auto-scaling, built-in monitoring, enterprise security (CMEK, VPC-SC, HIPAA), multi-region support, managed infrastructure. Plus it demonstrates we can actually deploy this, not just run it locally."

## 🎤 **Q&A Prep**

**Q: Why not just use one LLM directly?**  
A: "Single-agent systems lack specialization and collaboration. Our 7-agent system allows for: (1) Specialized expertise per task, (2) Parallel processing, (3) Cross-validation through A2A communication, (4) Consensus building over 3 loops. Plus we demonstrate Google's A2A protocol vision."

**Q: How do you prevent hallucinations?**  
A: "Multi-layered validation: (1) GitHub MCP provides real data, (2) 3-loop analysis with cross-validation, (3) QA Validator scores 4 dimensions, (4) Improvement loop if quality < 85, (5) Human-readable output for verification."

**Q: What if repository is private?**  
A: "GitHub OAuth integration. Users authenticate, MCP accesses private repos with their permissions. Secure, user-controlled."

**Q: How long did this take?**  
A: "About 6-8 hours for implementation following our documented architecture. The innovation is in the multi-agent A2A orchestration and production deployment."

**Q: What's next?**  
A: "Three directions: (1) Agent marketplace - users can add custom analyzers, (2) Real-time code evaluation during interviews, (3) System design challenges beyond coding."
